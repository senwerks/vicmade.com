VicMade is an attempt at a git-based multi-user blog for makers/hackers to share their personal project updates. The users create posts using standard markdown files in their own repositories, and VicMade grabs those files, reformats them, and turns them into blog posts.

To start off with we are only allowing users from our [local hackerspace](https://www.ballarathackerspace.org.au) but once everything is dialled in we'll open it to more people if they want to contribute.
