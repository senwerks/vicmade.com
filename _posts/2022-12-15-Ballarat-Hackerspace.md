## Ballarat Hackerspace is a non-profit community-run hackerspace/makerspace in Victoria, Australia.

The front page of the [Ballarat Hackerspace website](https://www.ballarathackerspace.org.au) sums it up pretty well:

> We are a non-profit community group dedicated to providing education and resources to encourage skills in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM). The Ballarat Hackerspace provides tools, connections, community and other resources to help improve the skills of its members and the community, as well as encourage a culture of participating in technology advances, rather than passively using them.

> We run casual social sessions, regular workshops, community meetups, and encourage growth in the community in the broader Victorian goldfields region.

The hackerspace side has a room full of 3D printers (Prusa i3's and Taz's, as well as some DIYs/kits and other random printers), multiple desktop computers you can use for Fusion360/Lightburn/etc, a well equipped electronics section with workbenches, solder/rework stations, reflow oven, and heaps of components that come included with membership. There's also lots of general desk space to sit at and work on your laptop or socialise, a member-built 1m x 1m 3D printer called "Megabot", a kitchen, and lots of interactive memnber projects you can play with and get inspired by.

The makerspace side has a pretty decently equipped workshop with table saw, standing drillpress, 900x600mm laser cutter, small CNC mill, and heaps of work benches with all the hand tools and power tools you could possibly need. Most of the actual furniture and storage in the space is built by members using these tools, and there's always group projects running to fit the space out better or build new equipment.

Here are some photos I took while there:
